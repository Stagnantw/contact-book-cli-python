## Overview

Welcome to the **Contact Book CLI** application! This beginner-friendly project is designed to help you practice Python programming while learning about object-oriented programming (OOP) and file handling. With this application, you can manage your contacts through a command-line interface (CLI) by performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. The app also includes full input validation and regex-based search functionality.

You can download the latest version of the app from the [Releases](https://github.com/Stagnantw/contact-book-cli-python/releases) section.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Easily create, read, update, and delete contacts.
- **Input Validation**: Ensure that all inputs are validated to avoid errors.
- **Regex Search**: Search for contacts using regular expressions for flexible querying.
- **File Handling**: Store contacts in a file for persistent data management.
- **OOP Design**: Utilize object-oriented programming principles for clean code structure.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Interact with the app directly from your terminal.

   git clone https://github.com/Stagnantw/contact-book-cli-python.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd contact-book-cli-python
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   If there are any dependencies listed, install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Latest Release**:
   You can download the latest version of the app from the [Releases](https://github.com/Stagnantw/contact-book-cli-python/releases) section. Follow the instructions there to execute the app.

## Usage

Once you have installed the app, you can start using it directly from your terminal.

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the following command to start the app:
   ```bash
   python contact_book.py
   ```

2. **Main Menu**:
   The application will display a menu with options to manage your contacts. You can choose from the following options:
   - Add a new contact
   - View existing contacts
   - Update a contact
   - Delete a contact
   - Search for a contact
   - Exit the application

3. **Adding a Contact**:
   When you select the option to add a contact, the app will prompt you for the necessary information, such as name, phone number, and email address. The input will be validated to ensure correctness.

4. **Searching for a Contact**:
   You can search for contacts using regex patterns. This allows for flexible and powerful search capabilities.

5. **Updating and Deleting Contacts**:
   The app allows you to update existing contacts or delete them entirely. You will need to provide the contact's identifier (like name or phone number) for these operations.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the app.
- **OOP Principles**: Classes and objects are used to structure the code.
- **File Handling**: Contacts are stored in a text file for persistence.
- **Regular Expressions**: Used for input validation and searching.
